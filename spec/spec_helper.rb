  # Loading more in this block will cause your tests to run faster. However, 
  # if you change any configuration or code from libraries loaded here, you'll
  # need to restart spork for it take effect.

  # --- Instructions ---
  # - Sort through your spec_helper file. Place as much environment loading 
  #   code that you don't normally modify during development in the 
  #   Spork.prefork block.
  # - Place the rest under Spork.each_run block
  # - Any code that is left outside of the blocks will be ran during preforking
  #   and during each_run!
  # - These instructions should self-destruct in 10 seconds.  If they don't,
  #   feel free to delete them.
