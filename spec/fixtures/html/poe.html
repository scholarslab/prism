<p>
Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered weak and weary,<br/>
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,<br/>
While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,<br/>
As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.<br/>
"'Tis some visitor," I muttered, "tapping at my chamber door -<br/>
Only this, and nothing more."<br/>
<br/>

Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December,<br/>
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.<br/>

Eagerly I wished the morrow; - vainly I had sought to borrow<br/>
From my books surcease of sorrow - sorrow for the lost Lenore -<br/>
For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels named Lenore -<br/>
Nameless here for evermore.<br/><br/>

And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain<br/>
Thrilled me - filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;<br/>
So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating<br/>
"'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door -<br/>
Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door; -<br/>
This it is, and nothing more."<br/><br/>

Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,<br/>
"Sir," said I, "or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;<br/>
But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,<br/>
And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,<br/>
That I scarce was sure I heard you" - here I opened wide the door; -<br/>
Darkness there, and nothing more.<br/><br/>

Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,<br/>
Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;<br/>
But the silence was unbroken, and the darkness gave no token,<br/>
And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, "Lenore!"<br/>
This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, "Lenore!"<br/> 
Merely this and nothing more.<br/><br/>

Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,<br/>
Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.<br/>
"Surely," said I, "surely that is something at my window lattice;<br/>
Let me see then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore -<br/>
Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore; -<br/>
'Tis the wind and nothing more!"<br/><br/>

Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,<br/>
In there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore.<br/>
Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;<br/>
But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door -<br/>
Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door -<br/>
Perched, and sat, and nothing more.<br/><br/>

Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,<br/>
By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,<br/>
"Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou," I said, "art sure no craven.<br/>
Ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the nightly shore -<br/>
Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!"<br/>
Quoth the raven, "Nevermore."<br/><br/>

Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,<br/>
Though its answer little meaning - little relevancy bore;<br/>
For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being<br/>
Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door -<br/>
Bird or beast above the sculptured bust above his chamber door,<br/>
With such name as "Nevermore."<br/><br/>

But the raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only,<br/>
That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.<br/>
Nothing further then he uttered - not a feather then he fluttered -<br/>
Till I scarcely more than muttered "Other friends have flown before -<br/>
On the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have flown before."<br/>
Then the bird said, "Nevermore."<br/><br/>

Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,<br/>
"Doubtless," said I, "what it utters is its only stock and store,<br/>
Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful disaster<br/>
Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore -<br/>
Till the dirges of his hope that melancholy burden bore<br/>
Of 'Never - nevermore.'"<br/><br/>

But the raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling,<br/>
Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and door;<br/>
Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking<br/>
Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore -<br/>
What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore<br/>
Meant in croaking "Nevermore."<br/><br/>

This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing<br/>
To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;<br/>
This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining<br/>
On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o'er,<br/>
But whose velvet violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o'er,<br/>
<i>She</i> shall press, ah, nevermore!<br/><br/>

Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer<br/>
Swung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.<br/>
"Wretch," I cried, "thy God hath lent thee - by these angels he has sent thee<br/>
Respite - respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore!<br/>
Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe, and forget this lost Lenore!"<br/>
Quoth the raven, "Nevermore."<br/><br/>

"Prophet!" said I, "thing of evil! - prophet still, if bird or devil! -<br/>
Whether tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,<br/>
Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted -<br/>
On this home by horror haunted - tell me truly, I implore -<br/>
Is there - <i>is</i> there balm in Gilead? - tell me - tell me, I implore!"<br/>
Quoth the raven, "Nevermore."<br/><br/>

"Prophet!" said I, "thing of evil! - prophet still, if bird or devil!<br/>
By that Heaven that bends above us - by that God we both adore -<br/>
Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,<br/>
It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels named Lenore -<br/>
Clasp a rare and radiant maiden, whom the angels named Lenore?""<br/>
Quoth the raven, "Nevermore."<br/><br/>

"Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!" I shrieked upstarting -<br/>
"Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore!<br/>
Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!<br/>
Leave my loneliness unbroken! - quit the bust above my door!<br/>
Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!"<br/>
Quoth the raven, "Nevermore."<br/><br/>

And the raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting<br/>
On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;<br/>
And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,<br/>
And the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;<br/>
And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor<br/>
Shall be lifted - nevermore!</p>
