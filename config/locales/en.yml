    prism_title: About Prism
    description_p1_html: >-
      Prism is a tool for "crowdsourcing interpretation." Users are invited to provide an interpretation of a text by highlighting words according to different categories, 
      or "facets."  Each individual interpretation then contributes to the generation of a visualization which demonstrates the combined interpretation of all the users.
      We envision Prism as a tool for both pedagogical use and scholarly exploration, revealing patterns that exist in the subjective experience of reading a text. 
    description_p1half_html: >  
      The concept emerged from a decade-long conversation on categories of textual interpretation which took place at the University of Virginia, and specifically from <a href="http://www.scholarslab.org/digital-humanities/crowdsourcing-interpretation/">transparency mark-up games</a> played by UVa Media Studies students and at <a href="http://books.google.com/books/about/SpecLab.html?id=VPXCk396uPYC">SpecLab</a>:
    description_p2: >
      the original game involved shared, Xeroxed page images, transparent overlays, dry-erase markers, a common interpretive prompt, and a moment in which 
      somebody yelled ‘Stop!’ and the transparencies were stacked up for discussion. (Nowviskie)
    description_p3_html: >-
      At SpecLab, Jerome McGann and Johanna Drucker <a href="http://nora.lis.uiuc.edu:3030/companion/view?docId=blackwell/9781405103213/9781405103213.xml&chunk.id=ss1-3-4&toc.depth=1&toc.id=ss1-3-4">further 
      developed the concept</a>, which became known as the "Patacritical Demon" &mdash; the best bit of vaporware (not) to emerge from UVa at the turn of the century.
    description_p4_html: >-
      The Scholars' Lab offered these un-realized concepts as inspiration for the first project to be undertaken by graduate student fellows of the
      <a href="http://praxis.scholarslab.org/">Praxis Program</a> in its inaugural year. The task of <a href='/pages/alumni'>the 2011-2012 team</a> of students was to determine how to translate the physical exercise 
      of marking a text into a digital one. They chose to employ a constrained interpretive vocabulary and to limit the length of the text in
      order to stay true to the transparency game. Like the transparency exercise, the end goal of Prism was to produce <a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/companion/view?docId=blackwell/9781405103213/9781405103213.xml&chunk.id=ss1-4-10">aesthetic provocations</a>, that is, visualizations which provoke further discussion.  
    description_p5_html: >-
      The 2012-2013 cohort of Praxis fellows (listed below) retained the vision set by the original team.  Their goal was to expand Prism to a format that would promote classroom use and scholarly conversation.  This led them to define two primary objectives.  
      The first was the ability for users to upload their own texts and to define their own interpretive categories.   The second was to create a more inviting and user-friendly environment that would encourage participation and exploration.  To that end, they redesigned the website, paying special attention to workflow, ease of use, and aesthetic concerns.  
      In addition, both the simple visualization feature and highlighting function were refined, in hope that Prism can now be more easily employed by the user for a variety of interpretive projects.

    praxis_description_html: >
      <a href='http://praxis.scholarslab.org/'>The Praxis Program</a> is a key mentoring and training project of the <a href='http://www2.lib.virginia.edu/scholarslab/'>
      Scholars' Lab</a> at the <a href='http://www.lib.virginia.edu/index.html'>University of Virginia Library</a>, in which six humanities graduate students 
      spend a year in a collaborative, hands-on, digital humanities apprenticeship. The program’s goal is to better equip knowledge workers for emerging 
      faculty positions and <a href=http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/alt-ac/'>alternative academic careers</a> at a moment in which new questions can be asked and new systems built. Visit the Praxis Program 
      site to learn more about the program’s evolving curriculum and to hear directly from Praxis Fellows and Scholars’ 
      Lab faculty and staff as they <a href='http://www.scholarslab.org/blog/'>blog</a> about their experiences. The first two, pilot years of the Praxis Program were supported by a generous grant from the Mellon Foundation to UVa Library's <a href="http://uvasci.org">Scholarly Communication Institute</a>, which also allowed the Scholars' Lab to create a broader <a href="http://praxis-network.org/">Praxis Network</a>, in collaboration with six other universities in three countries.
